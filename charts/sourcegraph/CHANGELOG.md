# Changelog

All notable changes to Sourcegraph are documented in this file.

### Changed

- **IMPORTANT** `cadvisor` now defaults to run in `privileged` mode. This allows `cadvisor` to collect out of memory events happening to containers which can be used to discover underprovisoned resources. If you have your own monitoring infrastructure, you may choose to disable `cadvisor` or set `cadvisor.containerSecurityContext.privileged=false` in your override file. [#121](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/pull/121)
- Uses of alpine-3.12 docker image have been updated to use alpine-3.14 [#124](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/pull/124/)

Sourcegraph 3.39.0 is now available!

- [Update](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/admin/updates)
- [Release post](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/release/3.39)

### Added

- Added initContainer and pgsql-exporter to Code Insights statefulset in support of Postgres migration [#106](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/pull/106), [#107](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/pull/107)

### Changed

- **BREAKING** Database credentials are now rendered as secrets by default and support referencing an existing secret. Credentials can be customized with `pgsql.auth`, `codeIntelDB.auth`, and `codeInsightsDB.auth`. If you previously customized the credential env vars (for instance, to use an external database), you must update your override to use the new configuration. [#86](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/pull/86), [#98](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/pull/98)
- **BREAKING** Redis endpoints are now rendered as secrets by default and support referencing an existing secret. Endpoint configuration can be customized with `redisStore.connection` and `redisCache.connection`. If you previously customized the endpoint env vars, you must update your override to use the new configuration. [#100](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/pull/100)
- **BREAKING** Minio credentials are now rendered as secrets by default and support referencing an existing secret. Credentials can be customized with `minio.auth`. If you previously customized the credential env vars, manual updates may be required. [#85](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/pull/85)
- **CAUTION** Migrated Code Insights from Timescale to Postgres. If you have customized the configmap or connection parameters for codeinsights-db, manual updates may be required. [#74](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/pull/74)
- **CAUTION** Updated resource name generation to be more standard. If you were previously customizing names, some resources may update to reflect your customization. [#97](https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/pull/97)
- As a result of the above credential changes, relevant deployments / statefulsets will now automatically restart when credential values have updated.
