# GCP

Deploy Sourcegraph on GKE and use [Container-native load balancing through Ingress] to make Sourcegraph publicly accessible.

## Get started

Deploy or upgrade Sourcegraph Helm chart with the provided [override.yaml](./override.yaml). This will create a public-facing load balancer that supports HTTP traffic. You can then access your deployment via the IP of the load balancer.

**To enable HTTPS**, provide [your own SSL cert] or use [Google-managed certificates].

The override file includes a [BackendConfig] CRD. This is necessary to instruct GCP load balancer how to perform healthcheck on our deployment.
