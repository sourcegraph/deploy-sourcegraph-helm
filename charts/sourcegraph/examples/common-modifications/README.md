# Common modifications: resource limits, replica counts, disk size

This override file includes all Sourcegraph services and their default resource requests/limits, replica counts, and storage sizes.

This can be used as a starting point for customizing Sourcegraph to meet your own usage requirements. The [Resource Estimator] can provide some guidance on adjusting resources.
