{{- if not .Values.prometheus.privileged }}
ðŸš§ Warning ðŸš§

You have set 'prometheus.privileged' to 'false' and Prometheus will run with reduced privileges.
Our observability stack requires some cluster-wide privileges to display provisioning metrics.
These metrics provide critical information to help you scale the Sourcegraph deployment.
Provisioning metrics can be restored by assigning elevated permissions to Service Account '{{ include "sourcegraph.serviceAccountName" (list . "prometheus") }}'.
Consult https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/blob/main/charts/sourcegraph/templates/prometheus/prometheus.ClusterRole.yaml for the necessary permissions.

{{- if not .Values.cadvisor.containerSecurityContext.privileged }}
ðŸš§ Warning ðŸš§

You have set 'cadvisor.containerSecurityContext.privileged' to 'false' and cadvisor will run with reduced privileges.
Our observability stack requires to be run in privileged mode to display a provisioning metric, out of memory events.
Such metric provides critical information to help you scale the Sourcegraph deployment.
If you would like to bring your own infrastructure monitoring & alerting solution,
you may want to disable the `cadvisor` DaemonSet completely by setting `cadvisor.enabled=false` in your override file.
