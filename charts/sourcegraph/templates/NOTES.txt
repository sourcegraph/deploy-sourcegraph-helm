ðŸš§ Warning ðŸš§

You have set 'prometheus.privileged' to 'false' and Prometheus will run with reduced privileges.
Our observability stack requires some cluster-wide privileges to display provisioning metrics.
As a result, our built-in observability stack will not function properly. 
These metrics will provide critial information to help you scale the Sourcegraph deployment.
Therefore, please assign proper permission to Service Account '{{ include "sourcegraph.serviceAccountName" (list . "prometheus") }}'.
You can do so by creating the proper ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding. 
You may consult https://github.com/sourcegraph/deploy-sourcegraph-helm/blob/main/charts/sourcegraph/templates/prometheus/prometheus.ClusterRole.yaml
for a list of expected permissions.
