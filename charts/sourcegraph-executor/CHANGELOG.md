## Unreleased

* Added new chart `sourcegraph-executor-k8s` to deploy Sourcegraph executors that use Kubernetes jobs.
* **BREAKING:** Renamed `sourcegraph-executor` chart to `sourcegraph-executor-dind` to indicate these are Docker in Docker executors. To update to newer versions of this chart, ensure the new Chart name is used.
