# Sourcegraph Helm Chart Release

> Sourcegraph helm chart may be released outside the regular [Sourcegraph releases] schedule, these steps are required whenever releaseing a new version.

## 1. Bump the `version` in `Chart.yaml`

Double check the `CHANGELOG.md` to see if there are any `**BREAKING**:` changes and follow [semver] to bump chart `version` accordingly. Increase the minor version for a breaking change or Sourcegraph upgrade, patch version for a backwards-compatible change.

## 2. Update autogen docs

`README.md` is generated by [helm-docs] based on `values.yaml`.

Run `./scripts/helm-docs.sh` to update the `README.md`.

## 3. Create a Pull Request

Create a new release branch

```sh
git checkout -b <chart-name>/release-x.y.z
```

Commit all changes and open a Pull Request.
