### Test plan

<!--
  As part of SOC2/GN-104 and SOC2/GN-105 requirements, all pull requests are REQUIRED to
  provide a "test plan". A test plan is a loose explanation of what you have done or
  implemented to test this, as outlined in our Testing principles and guidelines:
  https://docs.sourcegraph.com/dev/background-information/testing_principles
  Write your test plan here after the "Test plan" header.
